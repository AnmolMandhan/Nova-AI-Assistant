# Nova - AI Assistant 🤖

Nova is a powerful AI-based voice assistant built using Python. It provides both GUI and voice-based interactions to help users with a wide range of tasks like checking the weather, playing music, web searches, to-do list management, sending emails, and answering general questions using an AI model.

## ✨ Features & Functionality

Below is a list of Nova's core features with brief explanations:


| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🎙️ **Voice Recognition** | Listens to your commands using `speech_recognition` and a microphone. |
| 🧠 **AI Responses (Hugging Face)** | Uses Zephyr-7B model from Hugging Face for natural language responses when it doesn’t match any predefined command. |
| 🌤️ **Weather Updates** | Speaks and shows the current weather of any city using OpenWeatherMap API. |
| 📆 **Date & Time Reporting** | Tells the current date and time using the system clock. |
| 🎵 **Music Playback** | Plays a song on YouTube using `pywhatkit` — just say "Play music [song name]". |
